Azure messaging services:
- Service Bus queues := messaging e.g. placing/scheduling orders handled by decoupled programs
			  topics := use filters on the same message to distribute to multiple subscribers
- Service Grid := discrete facts, point-in-time events, integrating with external apps
				  event routing service for serverless apps, publish/subscribe model
- Events Hub := time series facts from sensors in realtime
- IoT Hub := subset of events hub for IoT devices
- Logic Apps := no-code workflow automation service for integrating apps, data, services, and systems

Service bus = 	PubSub message queue-oriented broker, 
				PaaS, 
				JMS 2 + AMQP 1 standards compliant,
				Azure SDK
 
AMQP protocol can be implemented thru Apache Qpid

Service Bus Namespace = virtual broker 
- queues = point-to-point communication, one producer and one consumer
- topics = publish/subscribe communication, one producer and multiple consumers

queue = exclusive assignment of jobs thru a sequential log
queue attributes:
- Max msg size = 1MB
- Max queue size = 80GB
- Max consumers = 5000 (msg are locked exclusively to one consumer until they are processed)

sessions = subqueues / multiplexing, order seq of msg sharing an id 
		   => consumer acquire an exclusive lock on the entire session

Transactions = atomic, scope: between consumer and queue

Topic = subscription associated with a filter/id, topics are named multicast distribution points for messages

Authorization:
- Active Directory RBAC
- Shared Access Signatures (SAS) with entity policy


-------------
Optimization (performance/cost):
- partitioning = multiple queues for parallel processing
- balance storage costs and access frequency
- ScaleSet = auto-scaling of VMs as workload increases
- Azure Functions = serverless compute service for event-driven workloads scalability
- Azure Batch = run parallelized workloads (e.g. ML) / auto-scaling / job scheduling / orchestration of tasks
- SQL = batch, parallelism, partitioning, columnstore indexes (OLAP), rowstore indexes + in-memory tables (OLTP)
- Monitor index usage - Use sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats to identify unused indexes

Security/Networking/Observability:
- resource groups = logical containers for resources
- security groups = control access to resources
- subcription = billing unit for Azure resources; separate resources into different subscriptions
- Azure AD = identity management
- SAS = shared access signature
- gateways = secure access to on-premises resources; route-based or policy-based
- VNet = virtual network for secure communication between resources
- Azure Firewall = network security service for monitoring and controlling traffic
- Security Center = unified security management and threat protection
- Sentinel = cloud-native SIEM for intelligent security analytics
- Azure Monitor = collect, analyze, and act on telemetry data from Azure resources
- Application Insights = monitor performance and usage of applications
- Log Analytics = collect and analyze log data from various sources
- Azure Advisor = personalized best practices and recommendations for Azure resources
- Azure Policy = enforce organizational standards and assess compliance at scale
- Azure Blueprints = define and manage a set of resources and policies for compliance
- Azure Resource Manager = manage resources in a consistent way

Data governance:
- data discovery
- access control
- data lineage 
- auditing
- cataloging
- data quality
